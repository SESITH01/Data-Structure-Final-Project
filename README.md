Hi! Welcome to my Data Structures Individual Final Project!

For this project, I pulled a dataset on board games - with the name, year, amount of time it takes to play, and the rating. I used a BST (binary search tree) to organize the board games based on year. After printing all games in order, the program asks for a user input year, and will print all the board games made in and after that year.
