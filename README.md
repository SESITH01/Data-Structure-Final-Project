# About

Welcome to my Data Structures Individual Final Project!

## Overview

For this project, I worked with a dataset containing information about board games, including their names, release years, durations, and ratings. Using Binary Search Trees (BSTs), I organized the board games based on their release years to efficiently manage and retrieve the data.

## Features

- **BST Implementation:** Utilized a Binary Search Tree to organize board games chronologically by their release years.
- **Data Organization:** Sorted the board games in ascending order of their release years for easy access and manipulation.
- **User Interaction:** The program prompts users to input a specific year, and then displays all board games released in that year and onwards, providing customized information.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the executable file to start the program.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the program:
   - View a list of board games sorted by release year.
   - Enter a specific year to see all board games released in and after that year.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about various board games, including their names, release years, durations, and ratings.
